1. We choose 1 because github action will take a look at the code to see if it works properly with no conflicts or bugs that will destroy the branch, then enables the code to merge. We can't choose 2 because every time manually checking takes a great effort and time. Github actions can check them automatically after we build the pipelines. Can't choose 3 either because that is catastrophic. 

2. No, because end-to-end test is mostly used to test whether a feature works properly by checking some subfeatures' return values to verify if the feature works as expected. Checking a specific returned value works better with unit testing. 

3. No, because the task requires much more than simply checking the returned output of a function. In addition, unit tests can't test how individuals components interact with each other inside a message feature. 

4. Yes, because unit test is intended for testing a single function expected output and actual output in a function level. For example, I can test whether giving it more than 80 characters will return false.
