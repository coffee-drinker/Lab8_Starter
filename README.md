# Lab 8 - Starter


1. We choose 1 because github action will take a look at the code to see if it works properly with no conflicts or bugs that will destroy the branch, then enables the code to merge. We can't choose 2 because every time manually checking takes a great effort and time. Github actions can check them automatically after we build the pipelines. Can't choose 3 either because that is catastrophic. 

2. No, end to end testing is for the validity of the entire program, which will test the entire website. So end to end is not a good way to test whether one function works.
